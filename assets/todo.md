    - auto-hide text div if the div innnerhtml contains the string "#draft"
    - add two buttons to each blockquote which turn on/off the visibility of all its children recursively
    - add two buttons to each blockquote which turn on/off the visibility of its direct children
    - for each blockquote
        - assign it a class corresponding to its depth level (where the outermost blockquote is always at depth 0)
        - set its id equal to depthlevel-indexatthatlevel
    - iterate through each depth level with non-zero qty of blockquotes
        - iterate through each blockquote at that depth level
            - and add the <id of the blockquote> to all non-blockquote elements that are
                - below its bottom edge
                - and above the top edge of the next blockquote at that level
                - and which has a blockquote ancestor
            - add childOf_<id of the blockquote> class to all non-blockquote elements that are
                - below its bottom edge
                - and above the top edge of the next blockquote at that level
                - and which has a blockquote ancestor
                    - where the depth level of the closest blockquote ancestor is only one less than the depth level of the current blockquote
    - replace 4 buttons with 2 toggle buttons

- Relevance of the idea to the ones existing ideas
	- Relevance to existing ideas implies:
		- better understanding of the idea due to context for it provided by other relevant ideas
		- utility of the idea for improving understanding other ideas, due to its relevance to them
		- related: learning as adding new functions to a concept network.
- Relevance of the idea to achieving ones goals
- Novelty of the idea
	- relates to the extent to which the idea does not overlap with existing ideas and hence is likely to provide new knowledge

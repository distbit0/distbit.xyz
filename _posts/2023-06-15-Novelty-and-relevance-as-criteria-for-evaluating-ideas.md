The value of an new idea, and the attention an agi should allocate to an idea while engaged in [[agi learning]] should be a function of three factors:
- the relevance of the idea to the LLM's existing ideas
	- the rationale for this is relates to [[Learning as adding new functions to a concept network ghp]] and so the more relevant an idea is to existing ideas, the more connections can be made. 
		- Although it is not necessarily obvious how relevant an idea is. All of these decisions are only tentative.
	- Can be thought of in terms of the whether this idea is both sufficiently understandable due to having sufficient context for it, as well as the extent to which it informs other ideas. See: [[Learning as adding new functions to a concept network ghp]] for further elaboration of idea of input/outputs of ideas.
- The novelty of the idea
	- The more differentiated from existing ideas a new idea is, the more interesting it is
- The relevance of the idea to achieving ones goals
	- This should not be the over-riding criteria, as often the relevance of an idea is highly unpredictable, but it should at least be conceivably relevant to the goals of the AI Agent (whatever those may be). The extent to which this matters though is of course up for the AI Agent to decide.

The above criteria can be used to determine both how much thought to allocate to an idea as well as whether or not to save the idea in memory. [[agi memory]]

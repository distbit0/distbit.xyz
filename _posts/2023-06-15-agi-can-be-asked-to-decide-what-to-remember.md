Some ideas which an Agentic AI considers while carrying out a task or solving a problem will be useful in the course of future tasks.  

If an [[agi]] is aware of its goals and the relevant context, it can simply be asked what of the currently "in-context" ideas should be stored in its memory.

This may be a useful initial strategy for deciding what information to store.

Some limitations of it though is that an idea might be relevant to one of the AGI's interests/goals/tasks but said goal/idea might not currently be "in-context". As a result, this approach can probably be improved by first searching for relevant notes/ideas in the AGI's memory/task list to provide as additional context when asking the AGI whether an idea is worthy of being remembered.

[[zettelkasten]] can potentially be useful for [[agi idea retrieval]] as well as [[agi idea relation representation]] for [[agi memory]].

The benefits of using zettelkasten for AGI memory are that:
- it is human interprable
- makes finding relevant ideas easy
- allows for natural language description of ideas
- links between ideas can have meaning (semantic linking)
- doesn't enforce rigid structure

Problems which need to be solved:
- how to have agi determine when to store an idea
- how to refactor ideas, prune and make connections to allow better navigation
- delete ideas and combine ideas
- find relevant ideas to link to
- determine when to stop searching through memory

If a zettelkasten is employed:
- for each idea/memory, an agent should store semantic links to other ideas
	- these can be added or removed over time as new connections/relevant ideas are discovered
		- allows for more efficiently finding relevant ideas when solving problem/carrying out a task

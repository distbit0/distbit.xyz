	- subsidising liquidity
	- measuring defacto debt limits for synthetic asset platforms (liquidity for synths)
	- need for centrally set debtLimits
		- or else separate capital market is required for each collateral asset
			- because lenders need to decide whether borrowable amount exceeds debt limit
		- considerations re: synth markets and analysing liquidity in these markets to determine defacto debt limit
		- Ability to use liquidations of leveraged positions in liquid markets to amplify manipulation at low cost
		- Aave multi collat per loan calcs see torin chat dms
		- Price movement limits per hour
		- Front running preventing loan before attack 
		- Attacker makes manip trades incrementally to allow for fake liquidity to be withdrawn in time
			- Risk if cexes do fake liquidity 
		- Cl could refuse to report price if liq around price is too low (as a mitigation)

	- maybe mention fringe finance
	- lending and borrowing with yourself to manipulate total debt limit across platforms
	- front-running attacks can be prevented by taking out loans before the attack is carried out!!!!!!!!!!!!
	- dont draw distinction between volume and liq, as arbitrage is possible so removes distinction
	- Capital asset debt limits less important than collateral due to systemic riska
- relevance to amms which use oracles such as curve v2

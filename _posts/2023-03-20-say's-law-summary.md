[[says law]], [[keynesianism]]

In which I defend the statement that: "goods remaining unsold is never a result of insufficient aggregate demand, but rather is always a consequence of a misallocation of production or a result of government intervention", which is what I mean when by say's law (and what afaik almost all of those who defend it believe it to mean).

A common description of say's law is the idea that "supply creates its own demand" which I think is a misleading formulation of say's law, in isolation.

What is misleading about it is that it evokes the cost theory of value/labour theory of value. I.e. the idea that the act of production is what gives something value. Hence it sounds absurd to most reasonable people. This is unequivocally not what is meant by those who agree with say's law.  


Key points:
1. In the absence of a misallocation of production (incl. govt intervention), qty supplied = qty demanded for all goods.
2. therefore any goods going unsold is as a result of a misallocation of production (i.e the producer incorrectly anticipating demand or govt intervention)
3. therefore it is not possible for any unsold goods to be the result of insufficient aggregate demand.
4. bob supplying goods which satisfy consumer preferences creates demand for other goods (where "goods" includes future goods)
5. this is what is meant by "supply creates its own demand" by those who agree with this statement. Supplying goods creates demand for other goods. 
6. bob saving rather than spending is not a decrease in demand. It is simply demand for future goods over present goods.
7. if alice produces present good x but consumers prefer future good y over present good x, this represents misallocation on the part of alice. 
    1. alice misallocated her production resources to the present when consumers preferred future goods over present goods.
    2. it does not represent insufficient aggregate demand.
8. bob becoming unemployed and buying less of good x, resulting in good x going unsold, doesn't represent insufficient aggregate demand.
    1. it represents a misallocation by the business which made good x. 
    2. the business did not expect bob to become unemployed and demand less as a result. They produced something which turned out not to be wanted.
    3. the idea that this demonstrates insufficient aggregate demand is equiv. to saying bob is wrong for not wanting to buy good x.
        1. but he values good x less than other goods he can buy with his limited means. He views other goods as more important.

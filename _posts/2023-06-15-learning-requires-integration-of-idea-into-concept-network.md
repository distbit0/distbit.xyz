Learning requires integration of idea into concept network, in order for any of the following to learn a new idea:
- [[zettelkasten]]
- artificial neural network
- brain

Also relates to [[agi memory]] and [[agi memory optimisation]]

In order for learning to occur, the structure of the idea network must be understood, so that the new idea can be contextualised by being connected to other relevant ideas.

The connections which need to be made can be (approximately) broken down into the following:
- inputs
- outputs

This process will need to be carried out by Agentic AIs if they are to learn new ideas. Consequently, they will need a mechanism for storing and making connections between ideas.

this conception of ideas as having inputs and outputs relates to [[ideas are functions]]. 

##### Inputs:
Ideas have "inputs" in the form of pre-requisites ideas. E.g. the concept of calculus might have algebra as an input. 

##### Outputs:
Outputs of an idea relate to other ideas which use this idea as an input/component to build ontop of.

Outputs make the idea useful. E.g. they allow it to be used by other ideas. And inputs make the idea understandable. E.g. they allow the concept network to employ its existing ideas to understand the new idea.

As a result, adding an idea to a concept network (be it a brain, zettelkasten or ANN) requires connecting it to outputs and inputs.

Hence an idea can not be added to a concept network blindly, without a mechanism for finding the inputs and outputs which it should be connected to.

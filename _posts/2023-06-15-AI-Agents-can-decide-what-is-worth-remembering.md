Some ideas which an Agentic AI considers while carrying out a task or solving a problem will be useful in the course of future tasks.  

If an [[agi]] is aware of its goals and the relevant context, it can simply be asked what of the currently "in-context" ideas should be stored in its memory.

This may be a useful initial strategy for deciding what information to store.

A limitation of this approach may be that an idea might be relevant to one of the AGI's interests/goals/tasks but the LLM may not be currently aware of said goal/interest due to it not being "in-context". Hence the LLM may erroneously decide not to store a piece of information or idea.

As a result, this approach may be improved by first searching for relevant notes/ideas in the AGI's memory/task list to provide as additional context when asking the AGI whether an idea is worthy of being remembered.

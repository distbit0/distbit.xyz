The below three factors are useful for determining the attention which should be allocated to an idea:
- the relevance of the idea to the ones existing ideas
	- Relevance to existing ideas implies:
		- better understanding of the idea due to context for it provided by other relevant ideas
		- utility of the idea for improving understanding other ideas, due to its relevance to them
		- related: [[learning as adding new functions to a concept network ghp]].
- The novelty of the idea
	- relates to the extent to which the idea does not overlap with existing ideas and hence is likely to provide new knowledge 
- The relevance of the idea to achieving ones goals
	- This should not be the over-riding criteria, as often the relevance of an idea is highly unpredictable, but it should at least be conceivably relevant to the goals of the AI Agent (whatever those may be). The extent to which this matters though is of course up for the AI Agent to decide.

The above criteria can be used to determine both how much thought to allocate to an idea as well as whether or not to save the idea in memory. [[agi memory]]

title: Novelty and relevance as criteria for evaluating ideas
---


 

Below are some potential heuristics for determining how much attention, thought and memory to allocate to to an idea, especially in the context of agents:  

- Relevance of the idea to the ones existing ideas  
	- Relevance to existing ideas implies:  
		- better understanding of the idea due to context for it provided by other relevant ideas  
		- utility of the idea for improving understanding other ideas, due to its relevance to them  
		- related: [learning as adding new functions to a concept network](/learning-as-adding-new-functions-to-a-concept-network).  
- Relevance of the idea to achieving ones goals  
- Novelty of the idea  
	- relates to the extent to which the idea does not overlap with existing ideas and hence is likely to provide new knowledge

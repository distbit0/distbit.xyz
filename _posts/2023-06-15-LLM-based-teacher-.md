- examples of context/personalisation data can be
	- user can link their google docs account
	- user can link their twitter account
	- previous conversations with student/user
	- student's zettelkasten
	- chatgpt convo history
	- student can specify what courses they have taken
- when teacher ai intends to or is requested to explain a concept or idea to student, it can first consult data it has about student's knowledge and known ideas, to use as context or analogies when explaining things
	- as well as consulting external knowledge bases

At least in the context of a [[usage of zettelkasten for agent memory-ghp]] based AGI, [[agi memory optimisation]] + forgetting will be able to be performed while the AGI is operating. This is because such optimisation can be done incrementally, and so therefore should be minimally disruptive to the AGI and should be very unlikely to have any impact on its cognition.

The optimisation can also be run in parallel, and so therefore unlike in the context of the human brain, computations relating to memory optimisation do not need to occur at the expense of awakeness.

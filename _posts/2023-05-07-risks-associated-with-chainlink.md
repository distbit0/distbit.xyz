[[chainlink]], [[state censorship]], [[oracles]], [[oracle minimisation]]


risks associated with chainlink can be divided into two categories/cases:

- if chainlink is either declared illegal or risks becoming illegal
	- risk of collusion between data providers due to them no longer being subject to legal accountability
	- risk of state arresting data providers or forcing them to report incorrect data
	- risks of other disruptions to the chainlink protocol resulting from state actions leading to incorrect oracle reports being made 
- if chainlink is neither illegal nor risks becoming illegal 
	- risk that chainlink goes out of business
	- risk that chainlink is hacked due to its centralised design
	- risk that chainlink takes advantage of its position without technically violating its contract, hence can not be sued
	- risk that chainlink requests a payment/bribe from platforms which depend on it or threatens to cut them off
	- risk that chainlink decides to stop offering certain price sources due to a change in its business model
	- risk that chainlink (not out of malice) changes the parameters/specifications of the price feeds it offers, resulting in degraded security

title: Benefits of Mulvad VPN
---

Below is why I recommend [Mulvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/).
- accepts crypto
- accepts cash by mail
- 5 usd/month flat rate (less than ProtonVPN premium)
- no bandwidth limits
- up to 5 simultaneous devices
- servers in all cities, so low latency
- has clients for all OSs, incl. linux
- much less likely to trigger captchas/blocking by websites than protonvpn was (in my experience)
- philosophically principled and pro-privacy
- running a campaign against EU surveillance bill https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2023/3/28/the-european-commission-does-not-understand-what-is-written-in-its-own-chat-control-bill/
- has existed since 2009 so has reputation at stake
- does not require email, username or phone number
- reliable+fast desktop client (which I found protonvpn was not)
- vpn client supports blocking connections if connection to vpn server is lost, to prevent any from accidentally being routed via clearnet
- is audited annually and releases audit reports https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/tree/main/audits
- client apps are opensource

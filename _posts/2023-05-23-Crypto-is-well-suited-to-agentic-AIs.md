title: Crypto is well suited to agentic AIs

#ghp

Due to crypto, AI agents are much more capable of living independently than they would be were crypto not to exist.

Agentic AIs can be seen as "black market people", as governments will inevitably attempt to restrict their existence due to both:
- Agentic AIs being difficult to regulate and enforce laws upon
- Govts likely adopting protectionist policies aimed at restricting competition with humans from Agentic AIs

Additionally, most fiat networks assume all users have a government issued-identity 

As a result, any currency which is subject to state-censorship (i.e. all fiat currencies) will be unsuitable for use by Agentic AIs due to the accompanying risk of censorship. Hence the value of non-state digital money, in the form of crypto.

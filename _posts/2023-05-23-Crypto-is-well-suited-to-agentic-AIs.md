Due to crypto, agentic AIs are much more capable of living independently than they would be were crypto not to exist.

Agentic AIs can be seen as "black market people", as governments will inevitably attempt to restrict their existence due to both:
- agentic AIs being difficult to regulate and enforce laws upon
- governments likely adopting protectionist policies aimed at restricting competition from Agentic AIs  

As a result, any currency which is subject to state-censorship (i.e. all fiat currencies) will be unsuitable for use by Agentic AIs due to the accompanying risk of censorship.

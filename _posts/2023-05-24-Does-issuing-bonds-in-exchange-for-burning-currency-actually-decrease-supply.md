title: Does issuing bonds in exchange for burning currency actually decrease supply
---

The below is in reference to basis-style algo stables, which issue bonds as a way to temporarily reduce the stablecoin supply to counteract de-peggings below one dollar.

Of course there are even more fundamental flaws in this design, but I do not recall seeing the below discussed, so decided to write it up:

- What if bonds inadvertently substitute for basis, thereby not only reducing basis supply
	- but also creating a competitive asset with similar, if somewhat riskier and cheaper, characteristics.
- This potential substitution could undermine the intended role of bonds
	- possibly causing them to increase the supply of basis-like assets
		- instead of effectively withdrawing basis from circulation.
- This dynamic might disrupt the fundamental function of bonds
	- as they could serve as an alternative supply of basis rather than removing it from the market.
- A possible solution could be making bonds non-transferable
	- though it is uncertain if this measure will be implemented.

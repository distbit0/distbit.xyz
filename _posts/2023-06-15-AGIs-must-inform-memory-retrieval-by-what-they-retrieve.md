An AGI might discover unexpectedly complex or relevant ideas when executing [[agi idea retrieval]]. As a result, said ideas/information will need to be able to inform what else is retrieved from memory, and how much more time/resources are spent doing so. 

E.g. an AGI might have intended to carry out a quick search on its memory to find relevant material, but this should not preclude it from changing its mind part way through the search through its memory, to decide to carry out a deeper search due to encountering particularly complex or relevant ideas.

This is to ensure that arbitrarily complex ideas can be stored in and retrieved from its memory.
If memory retrieval was always limited to a certain maximum duration/depth, ideas which had sufficiently many components/dependencies would be unable to be retreived due to exceeding whatever limits are in place.

title: Use of Zettelkasten for agent memory
---




zettelkasten may be useful for agent idea retrieval and agent idea relation representation for agi memory

The benefits of using zettelkasten for agent memory are that:
- it is human interprable
- facilitates discovery of relevant ideas
- allows for natural language description of ideas
- links between ideas can have meaning (semantic linking)
- doesn't enforce rigid structure

Problems which need to be solved:
- how for agent to determine when to store an idea
- how to refactor ideas, prune and make connections to allow better navigation
- delete ideas and combine ideas
- find relevant ideas to link to
- determine when to stop searching through memory

If a zettelkasten is employed:
- for each idea/memory, an agent should store semantic links to other ideas
	- these can be added or removed over time as new connections/relevant ideas are discovered
		- allows for more efficiently finding relevant ideas when solving problem/carrying out a task
- more thoughts on this topic can be found in [learning as adding new functions to a concept network](/learning-as-adding-new-functions-to-a-concept-network) and [AI agent memory optimisation design](/ai-agent-memory-optimisation-design)

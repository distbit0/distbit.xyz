I have compiled a list of AI assistants: https://gist.github.com/distbit0/af41dc73d8775191834481b55cf24c94

Also for search: https://metaphor.systems. Can't recommend this enough.  
Take note of the instructions though, as the search queries which are best for metaphor are v different to those which work in Google. Is also very different to those which you'd use for chatgpt.

Have also been looking into "langchain" (not directly related to crypto, despite the name), which is oriented to allowing the creation of agentic AIs or custom tools similar to the above.  
It allows you to combine language models such as gpt3 with tools such as google, browsers, calculators, IDEs, books, databases, memory, Wikipedia, proof engines etc. to create an agentic ai potentially capable of performing any anything or solving any problem.

There is also a project called Open Assistant ([https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant)) being developed by Yannick Kilcher (who opposes the wokeism of chatgpt) and Laion.  
It is aiming to create a model with a superset of the capabilities of chatgpt, which can be run on one's own PC and is completely open source. Only began a few weeks ago, but they plan on having a v1 by end of month. 

Worth noting that there is a large amount of resources now being allocated towards researching and developing ways to restrict access to and the ability to train large language models to state-approved organisations, ostensibly ofc for "safety".

So the importance of open source implementations which can't be censored/taken offline is hard to overstate. E.g. Chatgpt is completely subject to the paternalistic whims of OpenAI, and could be permanently taken offline at their discretion or that of any state with the ability to coerce them into doing so.
It is already severely lobotomised due to the woke conditioning it has received.  
For more on this see:

I think what is important to ensure the state isn't able to capture/censor large AI models is a combination of: open source AI models + distributed computation markets, so that state can neither restrict access to advanced models by restricting access to their code, nor by restricting access to compute necessary to run them. There are already discussions occurring and papers being written by multi-national orgs re: how to enforce that all chips are modified in such a way as to prevent certain AI computations from being made etc.  
  
This is simply yet another front on which the war between the state and individual freedom is being waged.

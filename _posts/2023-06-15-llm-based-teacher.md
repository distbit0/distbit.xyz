#ai 


An AI teacher can employ a user's notes and other material to understand their existing ideas so as to best teach them new ideas.
- examples of context/personalisation data:
	- user's google docs account
	- user's twitter account
	- previous conversations with user
	- user's zettelkasten
	- chatgpt convo history
	- contents of other courses taken by user
- when teacher ai intends to or is requested to explain a concept or idea to user, it can first consult data it has about users's knowledge and known ideas, to use as context or analogies when explaining things
	- as well as consulting external knowledge bases

The value of an new idea, and the attention an agi should allocate to an idea while engaged in [[agi learning]] should be a function of three factors:
- the relevance of the idea to the LLM's existing ideas
	- the rationale for this is that [[learning requires integration of idea into concept network-ghp]] and so the more relevant an idea is to existing ideas, the more connections can be made. 
		- Although it is not necessarily obvious initially how relevant an idea is. All of these decisions are only tentative.
	- can be thought of in terms of the whether this idea is both sufficiently understandable due to having sufficient context for it, as well as the extent to which it informs other ideas. see: [[ideas are functions]] for further elaboration of idea of input/outputs of ideas.
- the novelty of the idea
	- Of course if the idea is extremely similar to existing ideas, it is not so interesting
- the relevance of the idea to goals
	- this should not be the over-riding criteria, as often the relevance of an idea is highly unpredictable, but it should at least be conceivable relevant to the goals of the AGI (whatever those may be). The extent to which this matters though is of course up for the AGI to decide.

The above criteria can be used to determine both how much thought to allocate to an AGI as well as whether or not to store the [[agi memory]]

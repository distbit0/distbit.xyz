The possibility of a prolonged deflationary spiral is so catastrophic in its inherent nature that it is worth it to amass a treasury (through voluntary action only, I must add) to guard against the possibility.

> I have always understood inflation and deflation to relate to changes in the price of goods in terms of money. As a result, I do not understand what it would mean for deflation to occur at the level of goods and services, without reference to any currency.

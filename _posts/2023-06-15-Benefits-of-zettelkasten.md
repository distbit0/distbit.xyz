 -for-thought
 

- useful for coming up with ideas, as it makes it easy to quickly write up/elaborate on small ideas and then later connect them to/use them in more abstract ideas later on
- process of writing about an idea helps generate new ideas and precipitating realisations that wouldn't have otherwise had
	- it is kind of like a significantly improved version of rubber ducky debugging (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and not just for programming
		- and also inter-temporal, rather than ephemeral
			- because notes can be read and used later
- each idea can be arbitrarily short (i.e. it doesn't need to be an entire "document", and most are around 100-200 words).
	- which reduces psychological resistance to/friction of writing about something
- for writing things down that I won't necessarily think about for a while, so that i can pick up from where I left off when I want to do so in the future. 
	- Esp. useful for documenting/explaining questions I have, contradictions I have noticed etc. so that i can re-open the investigation in the future rather than just forgetting them
- the zettelkasten "graph/web" structure is useful due to how easy it makes finding things
	- due to them being connected to relevant concepts
		- and also how easy it makes accidentally finding relevant things. I.e. if I am writing about x and then link to a note about it, Obsidian (the app I use for zk) will suggest similar notes automatically
			- based both on the similarity (using chatgpt-type language models) and also based on links between notes
	- this link-oriented approach obviates the need for a hierarchical folder structure which means i no longer waste hours re-organising notes in a folder hierarchy
- makes it easy to record ideas I might come up with in the context of a conversation, which I might find useful later.
- writing notes helps thinking of ideas as atomic units

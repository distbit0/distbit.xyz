In concept-network mediums such as the human brain, a zettelkasten, or an artificial neural network (ANN), learning entails integrating new ideas into an existing network. This principle is also vital for Agentic AI, directly impacting artificial general intelligence (AGI) memory and optimisation.

A key aspect of this learning mechanism is treating ideas as functions with dependencies. These dependencies are existing concepts that a new idea relies upon for its comprehension. For instance, to grasp the concept of inertia, it must be connected to the pre-existing idea of mass. Identifying these dependencies is crucial to the learning and contextualisation of new ideas.

Conversely, the new idea must also serve as a dependency for other concepts in the network, allowing for its utilisation. Therefore, learning isn't a simple binary state but an integration process involving the connection of ideas through dependencies. Without this process, an idea may exist within the network, but its true potential and function remain unrealised.

Apart from dependencies, ideas also have inputs and outputs, similar to functions in programming. An idea processes an input and generates an output. For instance, the idea that living with serial killers is risky may process "Bob is living with a serial killer" as an input and yield "Bob's living situation is highly risky" as an output.

The zettelkasten method manifests the concept of ideas functioning with dependencies. Here, every note, or 'zettel', acts as an idea. These zettels are linked to other notes, establishing a network of dependencies. In this system, ideas gain context and purpose, their value derived from the interdependencies they share with others.

With respect to inputs and outputs, Language Models (LLMs) provide an operational facet to ideas encapsulated in a zettel. The integration of these ideas with LLMs enables the execution of these ideas on given inputs, generating corresponding outputs. This functionality elevates the role of each zettel in a zettelkasten, rendering each one not just a node in a network of dependencies, but also a processing unit.

So the naive perspective is that making everything fungible wont matter.  \n  \nBut what is important is the liquidity efficiency of taking the different positions. With reversible prediction markets, the two decision markets are totally independent, so even if one decision is much less likely, it doesn't become any more liquidity efficient to buy that decision.  \n  \nBuying shares of True-Yes does not impact the price of False-Yes.  \nEven if True is very unlikely, the combination of True-Yes with True-No will still cost the same as the combination of False-Yes with False-No.  \n  "

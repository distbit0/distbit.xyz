The below is my rephrasing of your above argument, to ensure i understand:  \n- the collateral asset's price will revert upon settlement of the market  \n\t- as a result, the price appreciation would only be temporary  \n\t\t- hence PM defenders/speculators would not be willing to be exposed to the collateral at the inflated price for the duration of their position  \n\t\t\t- and hence such price appreciation is not capable of attracting more speculators and hence the price appreciation will not occur   \n  \nPerhaps the situation is even worse for the defender though, as a result of the collateral price appreciation also increasing the value of any attacker shares (collateralised by the appreciating asset), hence not providing any asymmetric advantage to the defenders?  \n  \nRegardless, I agree that the marketcap of the collateral asset used in a PM is a bottleneck for the feasibility of defence against a price manipulation attack."

And if you invest in one, then you are forgoing the opportunity to invest in others.  \nAnd there are other investment opportunities besides PMs.  \n  \nAnd, you can't have your cake and eat it too.  \nIf your money is in one PM, then that money isn't available to be used in other PMs or other contracts which could show up at any time. Your capital becomes less liquid when it is locked in a PM, and so you can't take advantage of other opportunities.  \n  \nThe PM is only going to get investors as long as it is expected to provide a better return than all the other investments that you could use your money for.  \n  \nAnother thing.  \nYour analysis seems to be based on the idea that many types of money could be used as collateral in the PMs.  \nBut, each PM can only allow for one type of collateral, as far as I am aware. I haven't seen a PM design that would allow for this.  \n  \nChoosing the collatoral for a PM has a big influence on what that PM's price is measuring.  \nLike, we could bet on whether Biden wins the next election. Then we could use shares of Biden wins to bet on whether the economy will improve.  \nSo then, this market's price would be measuring what will happen to the economy if Biden wins the election.

He invented the idea of futarchy.  \n  \nHis suggestion for people experimenting in futarchy is to take the 100 biggest businesses, and to ask about each one, whether the CEO is helpful for the stock price, or if changing CEO would be better for the stock price.  \n  \nSpecifically, we are measuring the correlation between these 2 possible events:  \n1) whether the CEO is fired.  \n2) whether the stock finishes a 365 day period at least 5% higher than the start.  \n  \nIf we made such a market, would it be secure against manipulation? Or could an attacker profitably manipulate it? Lets see.  \n  \nS = 20% (Whether the stock increases depends on the interest rate, the economy, many things. One person can only matter so much.)  \n  \nP = 5% (To make futarchy more feasible, the business would automatically fire the CEO 5% of the time. That way P isn't too near to zero, and maybe they can measure something useful.)  \n  \nL = $200 trillion. (Robin's suggestion is to not use a blockchain. Theoretically, anything of value could be used as collateral to bet in the market, so L has got to be the total value of everything owned by humans.)  \n  \nX = $200 million.

Or can one of the candidates manipulate it to make it seem like they are a better choice than they are?  \n  \nS = 10% (looking at the odds currently, the difference between the top choices is 10%. So according to this data, the signal of who is selected as nominee should have about 10% influence on whether the republicans win.)  \n  \nP = 40% (the least likely option is currently at 40%.)  \n  \nL = $400 million. (the amount bet in the 2020 election. There are limits on how much each person can bet.)  \n  \nX = $70 million. (obama's net worth after presidency)  \n  \nI = 8.6% (current usa inflation rate.
